    Exploratory Data Analysis of Earthquakes in 2013
=======================================================

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) brings out insights between different dimensions of the data which translate into interesting conclusions between the real-world parameters these dimensions are representative of.

* EDA is conducted on data provided as part of Doing Data Science - O’Neill & Schutt from O’Reilly - the NYT and RealDirect datasets from O'Reilly's book webpage.

* The same techniques are applied to a new dataset - List of earthquakes and their information such as magnitude, depth, location, etc., obtained from from [U.S. Geological Survey website](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/).

* The dataset of each source is given in the <Source>_dataset folder. The R scripts assume to find the datasets in the CWD, so please change that as appropriate.
